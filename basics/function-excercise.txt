d) Octal number - Decimal Conversion
e) Octal Number - Binary Conversion
f) Decimal Number - Hexa Conversion

Create an Outer / Wrapper Function called e.g NS
NS Contains a) to h) functions  and based on the argument u pass to NS function it return the required function, After getting the required function from NS , we pass that function to printNS function , this function is responsible to invoke the required Number System Function and get the result and return that result to the main function. The Base 2,8,16 is the common thing for all the Number System Functions.
main print the final result.

We are able to See : Outer Inner function concept
Callback Function
Function return function
